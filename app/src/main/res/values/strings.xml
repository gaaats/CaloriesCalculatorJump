    <string name="text_activity_good">Regular exercise, good sleep and a healthy diet are important pillars for a healthy body. Exercises that are based on jumping are a great way to help you stay fit, active and in good shape. Jumping is regarded as a type of anaerobic exercise because it involves quick bursts of energy for which your body does not rely on oxygen delivery alone. Because a lot of quick energy supply has to be delivered while jumping, your body digs into the stored energy also. Other anaerobic exercises include sprinting, heavy weightlifting and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Jumping requires no equipment or any specialized gear. Thus, it can be a part of a home-based exercise routine. If you travel often, you donâ€™t need to carry any weights or other gear with you.</string>
